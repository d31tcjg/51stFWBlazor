                Welcome to the legendary 36th Fighter Squadron, known affectionately
                as "The Fiends." As one of the premier squadrons in the 51st Fighter
                Wing, we emulate the real-world USAF squadron with a rich history and
                a tradition of excellence that dates back to our establishment in
                1917.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our squadron is equipped with the robust and powerful F-16 Fighting
                Falcon, colloquially known as the "Viper." With its advanced
                technology and powerful weaponry, the Viper gives us the ability to
                perform a diverse range of missions, from air-to-air combat to
                precision ground attack.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the 36th, we emphasize precision, discipline, and teamwork. Our
                virtual pilots are some of the most skilled aviators in the Digital
                Combat Simulator, constantly honing their skills to remain at the
                forefront of virtual aerial combat.
            </p>

            <p>
                Together, we've participated in numerous virtual conflicts, showcasing
                our tactical acumen and piloting skills in a variety of challenging
                scenarios. However, the 36th Fighter Squadron is more than just a
                group of flight simulator enthusiasts. We're a close-knit community
                with a shared passion for aviation and military history.
            </p>

            <p>
                As Fiends, we uphold the values of courage, dedication, and excellence
                in all that we do. Whether you're an experienced virtual pilot or a
                novice looking to earn your wings, you'll find a home with us at the
                36th Fighter Squadron.
            </p>

            <p>
                Join us and become part of the legend of the Fiends, continuing a
                legacy of superiority in the virtual skies.
            </p>
